üìä Business Case

**Executive Summary**

- In today's post-pandemic workforce, employee retention has emerged as one of the top concerns for organizations globally. According to Meritt Recruitment, citing data from the Work Institute, the global employee turnover rate climbed to around 20% in 2024, up from 18% in 2023. This increase underscores the challenges organizations encounter in maintaining employee retention. Understanding the factors that drive employee attrition is critical for especially for HR departments to develop data-driven retention strategies. High attrition leads to increased recruitment and training costs, productivity loss, and disruption in team dynamics. 
This analysis aims to investigates the relationship between employee attrition and key influencing factors such as work-related features, compensation, demographics and career trajectory. By uncovering patterns in these variables, I aim to identify high-risk employees, understand root causes of turnover, and recommend actionable retention strategies.

**Objective**

- The primary goal of this analysis is to gain actionable insights of how different employee attributes and workplace factors influence the likelihood of attrition.
